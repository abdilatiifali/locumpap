                <h3>18. VALIDITY</h3>
                <p>
                    If any of these Terms (or part thereof) is declared to be
                    unlawful, invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable,
                    this will have no effect on the validity and enforceability
                    of the remaining provisions (and parts thereof) of these
                    Terms and shall be replaced by an enforceable provision
                    which reflects the closest position to that intended by the
                    unlawful, invalid, void or unenforceable provision.
